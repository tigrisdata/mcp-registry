## üìã Step-by-Step Guide

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Fork this repository

Fork the repository to your own GitHub account and clone it locally.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Add your entry locally

Add your entry by creating a new folder following the `owner@name` template, and create a `server.yaml` inside describing your MCP server. You will need to provide:

- A valid name for your MCP
- The GitHub URL of your project. The project needs to have a valid Dockerfile.
- A brief description of your MCP Server.
- A category for the MCP server, one of:
  - 'ai'
  - 'data-visualization'
  - 'database'
  - 'devops'
  - 'ecommerce'
  - 'finance'
  - 'games'
  - 'communication'
  - 'monitoring'
  - 'productivity'
  - 'search'

#### üöÄ Generate folder and `server.yaml` using `task create`

You can use our command to automate the creation of the files. Let's assume we have a new MCP Server to access my org's database. My server's GitHub repo is located at: `https://github.com/myorg/my-orgdb-mcp`

You can call the creation tool passing the category (required), and github url. If your server requires any environment variables, pass them at the end with `-e KEY=value`.

```
task create -- --category database https://github.com/myorg/my-orgdb-mcp -e API_TOKEN=test
```

This will build an image using the Dockerfile at the root of the repository, run it while verifying the MCP server is able to list tools, and then create the necessary files. It will create a directory under `servers` as follows: `./servers/my-orgdb-mcp` and inside you will find a `server.yaml` file with your MCP definition.

```
name: my-orgdb-mcp
image: mcp/my-orgdb-mcp
type: server
meta:
  category: database
  tags:
    - database
about:
  title: My OrgDB MCP (TODO)
  description: TODO (only to provide a better description than the upstream project)
  icon: https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/182288589?s=200&v=4
source:
  project: https://github.com/myorg/my-orgdb-mcp
config:
  description: Configure the connection to TODO
  secrets:
    - name: my-orgdb-mcp.api_token
      env: API_TOKEN
      example: <API_TOKEN>
```

Remember that you need to specify all the env vars that you want to use in your server:

```
task create -- --category database https://github.com/myorg/my-orgdb-mcp -e API_TOKEN=test -e MY_ORG=my-org
```

If you don't specify all the environment variables, users will not be able to configure them properly in the UI.

Also, it's important to notice that env vars and secrets are handled differently. This is how a config block looks:

```
config:
  description: Configure the connection to AWS
  secrets:
    - name: tigris.aws_secret_access_key
      env: AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
      example: YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY_HERE
  env:
    - name: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
      example: YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_HERE
      value: '{{tigris.aws_access_key_id}}'
    - name: AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_S3
      example: https://fly.storage.tigris.dev
      value: '{{tigris.aws_endpoint_url_s3}}'
  parameters:
    type: object
    properties:
      aws_access_key_id:
        type: string
    required:
      - aws_access_key_id

```

This configuration will provide the following UI:

![UI Config Block](assets/img/config-ui.png)

If you want to provide a specific Docker image built by your organisation instead of having Docker build the image, you can specify it with the `--image` flag:

```
task create -- --category database --image myorg/my-mcp https://github.com/myorg/my-orgdb-mcp -e API_TOKEN=test
```

üîí If you don't provide a Docker image, we will build the image for you and host it in [Docker Hub's `mcp` namespace](https://hub.docker.com/u/mcp), the benefits are: image will include cryptographic signatures, provenance tracking, SBOMs, and automatic security updates. Otherwise, self-built images still benefit from container isolation but won't include the enhanced security features of Docker-built images.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Run & Test your MCP Server locally

After creating your server file with `task create`, you will be given instructions for running it locally. In the case of my-orgdb-mcp, we would run the following commands next.

```
task catalog -- my-orgdb-mcp
docker mcp catalog import $PWD/catalogs/my-orgdb-mcp/catalog.yaml
```

Now, if we go into the MCP Toolkit on Docker Desktop, we'll see our new MCP server there! We can configure and enable it there, and test it against configured clients. Once we're done testing, we can restore it back to the original Docker catalog.

```
docker mcp catalog reset
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Wait for review and approval

Upon approval your entry will be processed and it will be available in 24 hours at:

- [MCP catalog](https://hub.docker.com/mcp)
- [Docker Desktop's MCP Toolkit](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- [Docker Hub `mcp` namespace](https://hub.docker.com/u/mcp) (for MCP servers built by Docker)
